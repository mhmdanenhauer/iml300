    Physical Characteristics   
</h2>
</div>
<div class="textleft">
    <h3>Sexual Dismorphism</h3>
<p>The primary secondary sex characteristic of orcas is there dorsal fins: "In adult males, the dorsal fin is tall and triangular. Reaching a height of up to 1.8 m (6 ft.) in a large adult male, it is the tallest dorsal fin of all cetaceans.
In most females, the dorsal fin is slightly falcate (backward-curving) and smaller — about 0.9 to 1.2 m (3 to 4 ft.) tall.<sup>18</sup>"</p>
<h3>Coloration</h3>
<p>From SeaWorld:</p>
<p>Killer whales are black and white, with a gray patch called a "saddle" or a "cape" on the back, just behind the dorsal fin.

The large areas of black and white are distinctly separate.

The entire dorsal (top) surface and pectoral flippers are black except for the gray saddle.
The ventral (bottom) surface, lower jaw, and undersides of the tail flukes are mostly white. The undersides of the tail flukes are fringed with black.
An oval, white "eyespot" is just above and slightly behind each eye.
The size and shape of a killer whale's white areas and gray saddle vary greatly among ecotypes.
Conspicuous eye and saddle patches may help killer whales in groups coordinate social interactions, hunting, and swimming in formation.<sup>18</sup>

<h2>
Hunting Behavior</h2>
</div>
<div class="texttail">
    <p>From Sea World:</p>
<p>The distinctive coloration of killer whales is a type of disruptive coloration, a pattern that obscures the outline of an animal by contradicting the animal's body shape. In the flickering, filtered sunlight of the sea, other animals may not recognize a killer whale as a potential predator.

Killer whales are countershaded: the dorsal (top) surface is darker than the ventral (underneath) surface. When viewed from above, a countershaded animal blends in with the darker ocean depths. When viewed from below, the lighter belly surface blends in with the brighter sea surface.

While extremely rare, white killer whales have been observed. In British Columbia, one such animal was diagnosed with Chédiak-Higashi Syndrome, an inherited fatal disorder characterized by loss of pigmentation and not surviving to adulthood. Others appear to be full-grown adults and the cause of their white coloration is unknown.<sup>18</sup></p>
</p>
<p>From "Orca’s Signature Black and White Patterns Help Them Hunt and Hide" by Elizabeth Gamillo</p>
<p>To herd fish near the water’s surface, the whales use a herding strategy called the carousel method. Orcas will swim close to a school of fish and flash their white bellies toward them until they are positioned where the orcas want. Then, the orcas will smack their tails on the edge of the school of fish and eat any stunned fish.<sup>19</sup>
