<p>From the Natural History Museum (UK):</p>
<p>Killer whales (also called orcas) are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of their food chain. They feed on fish and squid like other odontocetes (toothed whales) do, but will also target seals, sea birds and even whale species far bigger than themselves.

Killer whales are also the only known predators of great white sharks.<sup>12</sup></p>
<p>From Anaïs Remili:</p>
<p>Killer whales have different diets throughout the North Atlantic. For example, killer whales in the Eastern North Atlantic (Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland) mainly feed on fish, specifically herring (for more details, check out the infographic below). Meanwhile, those in the Central North Atlantic (Greenland) prefer to consume seals such as ringed, harp, hooded, and bearded seals. Finally, killer whales in the Western North Atlantic (Eastern Canadian Arctic and Eastern Canada) tend to prey on other whale species, such as belugas and narwhals in the Arctic and baleen whales and porpoises in Eastern Canada.</p>
<p>
However, we were surprised to find significant differences in the diets of individual whales, even within the same populations. The results showed that individual killer whales within several populations exhibit different feeding preferences. For instance, some Eastern North Atlantic killer whales supplement their fish diet with marine mammals. At the same time, those in the Central North Atlantic show a generalist feeding pattern, consuming all available prey. Finally, individual killer whales in the Western North Atlantic tend to focus on either cetaceans (narwhals and belugas in the Arctic; baleen whales, and porpoises in Eastern Canada) or seals.<sup>12</sup>

Hunting Behavior</h2>
</div>
<div class="textright">
<p>From "The Killer Whale’s Killer Weapon — Its Brain" by PBS:</p>
<p>Contrary to the friendly depictions offered up by ocean theme parks, the killer whale (also known as the orca or blackfish), is the most devastating predator to roam the open oceans. It can weigh up to 11 tons, hit top speeds of 30 miles (48 kilometers) per hour and sports a mouth full of three-inch long interlocking teeth. In addition to these more obvious physical adaptations, the orca’s big brain–the second largest among ocean mammals–endows it with an intelligence unparalleled in an animal of its size.
</p>
<p>Orca intelligence isn’t unexpected given that it is a highly social animal that hunts in coordinated packs. Some of the smartest animals in the world–chimps, elephants, dogs, humans–are also highly social. As a result of their intelligence and sociability, killer whale pods have developed novel hunting strategies that are handed down through multiple generations. The techniques vary from region to region depending on available food items, but they are all are a testament to the killer whale’s keen predatory intelligence and ingenuity.<sup>13</sup>
</p>
<p>From Scott Dufield in BBC Wildlife:</p>
<p>Orcas will eat other species of dolphin, although they're harder to catch than some other prey because they can swim so quickly. In a high-speed chase, it's not easy for a killer whale to open its mouth due to the drag it would cause on its lower jaw, so orcas will typically ram dolphins to stun them before going in for the kill.

</p>
<p>Herding fish before stunning them with tail strikes is one of many ways in which these predators hunt their prey. As highly intelligent predators, orcas also work together in coordinated attacks to create waves that can knock prey off floating ice into the water.

Orcas have even learned the dangerous trick of beaching themselves to catch sea lions in Patagonia before wriggling back into the water.<sup>14</sup></p>
