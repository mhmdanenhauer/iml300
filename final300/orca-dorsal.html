    <h3>Echolocation</h3>
<p>From "Sound Strategy: Hunting with the Southern Residents, Part 2" by NOAA Fisheries:
</p>
<p>
When hunting, a killer whale sends out a series of clicks, called a click train, that spread through the water like a flashlight beam of sound. If the sound waves hit an object, echoes bounce back to the whale. Echolocation allows killer whales to detect fish at distances of up to 500 feet, much farther than they could see in the dark water.<sup>15</sup></p>
<h3>Brain</h3>
<p>From "Killer Whales Are Non-Human Persons" by Lars Crawford:</p>
<p>Postmortem MRI studies of the killer whale brain have shown that it is on the scale of 3.5-6.5 times as massive as a common bottlenose dolphin, another cetacean species that has demonstrated non-human-person-like qualities. Their brain also demonstrates an exquisite level of cortical folding similar to humans and other higher mammals (chimpanzees, but not macaques, for example), which indicates high amounts of cortical processing.</p>
<p>Killer whales’ demonstration of extremely coordinated group behavior and social interaction including both vocal and non-vocal cues arguably correlates with this vast expanse of the cortical areas mentioned above  [5]  . It certainly is true that upon observing killer whales, both in the wild and in captivity, that they exhibit a range of emotions from joy, fear, frustration, and anger, as well as self-awareness. As such, this generates a new set of ethical questions regarding the ways humans continue to interact with killer whales and other whale species by keeping them in captivity and killing them unnecessarily for food.<sup>15</sup></p>

<h3>Pods</h3>
<p>From NOAA Fisheries:</p>
<p>Killer whales are highly social, and most live in social groups called pods (groups of maternally related individuals seen together more than half the time). Individual whales tend to stay in their natal pods. Pods typically consist of a few to 20 or more animals, and larger groups sometimes form for temporary social interactions, mating, or seasonal concentrations of prey.<sup>16</sup></p>

<h3>Culture</h3>
<p>From "Understanding Orca Culture" by Lisa Stiffler:</p>
<p>Orcas have evolved complex culture: a suite of behaviors animals learn from one another. They communicate with distinctive calls and whistles. They can live 60 years or more, and they stay in tightknit matrilineal groups led by older females that model specific behaviors to younger animals. Scientists have found increasing evidence that culture shapes what and how orcas eat, what they do for fun, even their choice of mates. Culture, says Hal Whitehead of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, “may be very important to them.”
</p>
<p>Some of the first evidence of cultural differences among orcas came from studies of vocalizations in whales that frequent the coastal waters of British Columbia and Washington State. Such “residents” belong to four clans, each with multiple groups. While the clans live close together—their ranges even overlap—their vocalizations are as different as Greek and Russian. And smaller groups called pods have dialects akin to a Southern drawl or a clipped New England accent.<sup>17</sup>

<h3>Boat Attacks</h3>
<p>From: "The Mad Scientist and the Killer Whales" by Tomas Weber</p>
<p>The group of orcas that live around the Iberian Peninsula are the only killer whales that attack boats, and researchers know very little about them. There is only one scientific paper about their new hobby. The Portuguese government has advised sailors to stop moving if killer whales hit them, and wait for them to get bored — which is what Drion and Boyard did instinctively. The Spanish authorities, though, say keep going. In 2020, the Spanish government banned small sailing boats from a part of northwestern Spain. Meanwhile, the attacks are spreading. This community of orcas, documented in the Strait of Gibraltar since the Roman Empire, consists of nearly 90 animals. Some scientists believe that all of them now ram sailing boats. What triggered the behavior is unclear. One hypothesis, though, has taken off: The orcas are seeking revenge. 

</p>
<p>
    Orcas that have been documented attacking boats are called “Gladis” — from orca gladiator, one of the whale’s scientific names. Killer whales move around in matrilineal units, a mother with up to four generations of descendants. We don’t know which whale, or even which unit, was the first to start swimming into sailboats. Some believe it began in 2020 with Gladis Black — a male juvenile with a deep scar on his back from a wound, probably from a boat. Other researchers say it was Gladis White, an adult female from another unit. But whichever was the first, the others quickly began to copy them. 
</p>
<p>
    What looks like revenge against humans, Whitehead says, is a behavior that may be a kind of culture, a way this community of orcas now strengthens its group identity. Orca obsessions can quickly turn into collective fads. Take their eating habits. Most wild animals are not fussy gourmands. But the orcas that live in the seas around Antarctica eat tiny penguins, and when they kill them, they discard everything other than the breast muscles. Orcas that eat other whales usually enjoy only the lips and the tongue and leave the rest to wash up or rot. Each community of killer whales speaks in its own dialect, and off the coast of Australia, in a place called Shark Bay, orcas adorn their noses with ornamental sponges. In the 1980s, the salmon-eating orcas of the northeastern Pacific fashioned hats from the carcasses of their prey. They wore them all summer.<sup>17</sup>
