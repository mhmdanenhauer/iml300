<h3>Orca: </h3><p>The word <b>orca</b> is Latin, meaning a 'large bellied vessel<sup>1</sup>', though it came to also refer to the animal we know today. The scientific name is <i>orcinus orca</i>; <i>orcinus</i> is a masculine form of orca with no unique meaning. 
</p>
<h3>Killer Whale: </h3><p>Killer whale is a colloquial, but somewhat inaccurate term for orcas; "this common name comes from sailors and fishermen who observed the animals hunting and killing large whales and therefore called them 'whale killers.'<sup>2</sup>" (Whale Tales) This was mistranslated as killer whales. Though, when considering their feeding habits and behavior in captivity, this name might not seem inappropriate; however, their predatatory abilities that in fact allow them to kill much larger whales might be considered the more noteworthy quality.</p>
<h3>Blackfish: </h3><p>A catchall for aquatic animals, the term is forever linked to orcas especially due to the groundbreaking documentary <i>Blackflish</i><sup>3</sup>.</p>

    <h3>Haida </h3>
    <p>From "Killer Whales and Haida Culture" by Springtide Whale Watching:</p>
<p>The Haida myths and legends about killer whales tells how they are supernatural beings and how they basically ruled the underworld. The underworld in Haida culture refers to the ocean and everything in it. The killer whales had their own villages equivalent to the Haida villages on the surface with longhouses lined up with each other. The stories the Haida have about killer whales are endless, many of them end up being about a killer whale that stole a woman from the shore because he wanted to bring her back to his village and marry her.
</p>
<p>There are also stories about the origins of killer whales and stories of their strength. Some say killer whales descended from coastal wolves. There was a story about a man with two wolf pups who, as they grew bigger and bigger, would swim out to sea to hunt whales. They would bring whales back for dinner everyday until one day a heavy fog came in and the wolves became lost at sea, eventually turning into killer whales.
</p>
<p>There’s another story about how the supernatural beings were holding a contest. The island of Haida Gwaii was sinking, and to see who would be given the job of holding it up, they needed to see who the strongest. In this contest was a boy who had the ability to wear the skin of others. The contest was to see who can lay on a bed of hot coals the longest, the boy knowing the killer whales skin was the toughest, decided to cheat he took the killer whales skin and wore it when the supernatural beings weren’t looking, he won the contest. It is said he now holds up Haida Gwaii on a totem with his little pet ermine, when there is an earthquake on Haida Gwaii it is said to be the ermine running up and down the pole.<sup>4</sup>

<h3>Ancient Rome</h3>
<p>From <i>Orca: How We Came to Know and Love the Ocean's Greatest Predator</i> by Jason M Colby:</p>
<p>Gaius plinius secundus had witnessed a lot of violence in his life—war in Germania, Sicilian raids, Nero’s reign of terror—but killer whales really seemed to scare him. Known to history as Pliny the Elder, he penned the first known description of Orcinus orca in his encyclopedic Naturalis Historia, completed shortly before his death in 79 CE. It painted a bloody picture. The orca “cannot be in any way adequately described,” Pliny asserted, “but as an enormous mass of flesh armed with teeth.” Whereas dolphins sometimes befriended people and even helped fishermen, the killer whale preyed on mother baleen whales and their vulnerable calves. “This animal attacks the balaena in its places of retirement,” he wrote, “and with its teeth tears its young, or else attacks the females which have just brought forth, and, indeed, while they are still pregnant.” Fleeing whales could expect no mercy from orcas, who “kill them either cooped up in a narrow passage, or else drive them on a shoal, or dash them to pieces against the rocks.” So frightful were these battles to behold, Pliny noted, that it appeared “as though the sea were infuriate against itself.” In short, the destructive power of a killer whale had to be seen to be believed. Pliny himself had seen one. Around 50 CE, an orca had wandered into the harbor of Ostia, Rome’s port city. The animal had been drawn there, it seemed, by a ship from Gaul, which had run aground and spilled its cargo of hides. As the whale investigated, it became stuck in the shallows, unable to maneuver. Soon its back and dorsal fin were visible above the water, recounted Pliny, “very much resembling in appearance the keel of a vessel turned bottom upwards.” Sensing an opportunity, the emperor Claudius arrived from Rome, ordering local fishermen to net off the harbor. After waiting for a crowd to gather, he led his praetorians into battle against the trapped whale. The result was “a spectacle to the Roman people,” wrote Pliny. “Boats assailed the monster, while the soldiers on board showered lances upon it.” But the orca fought back, sinking at least one vessel before it succumbed. (Colby)<sup>5</sup>

<h3>Inuit</h3>
<p>"What the Inuit Taught Scientists About Killer Whales" by Greg Laden:</p>
<p>The Inuit knew about what the whales ate, how they hunted and captured prey, how the prey responded to the whales and when and where predation events occurred. The information provided by the Inuit agreed with the available published literature and expanded on it. For instance, both the TEK and the published information agreed that killer whales sometimes eat only certain parts of their prey, especially in the case of large whales. Also, small groups of killer whales, acting cooperatively, would attack large whales. The Inuit data suggested that the whales took any and all sea mammals, and in this area, either did not eat fish or hardly did so (it had not been observed). (Laden)<sup>6</sup>
</p>
<h4>kăk-whăn’-û-ghăt kǐg-û-lu’-nǐk</h4>
<p>From <i>The Eskimo about Bering strait</i> by Edward William Nelson:</p>
<p>
It is described as being similar in form to the killer whale and is credited with the power of changing at will to a wolf; after roaming about over the land it may return to the sea and again become a whale. While in the wolf form it is known by the above name, and the Eskimo say they know that this change takes place as they have seen wolf tracks leading to the edge of the sea ice and ending at the water, or beginning at the edge of the water and leading to the shore. ... These animals are said to be very fierce and to kill men. (Nelson)<sup>7</sup>
More commonly known as akhlut or akh'lut.

<h3>Popular Culture</h3>
<p>Orcas can be found all over the world, and therefore, they continue to be sources of fascination internationally. Popular contemporary works featuring orcas are:</p>
<h4><i>Free Willy</i> (1993)<sup>8</sup>, American</h4>
<p>A children's film about Willy, an abused captive orca. <i>Free Willy</i> inspired increased attention towards the conversation of orcas and the abuse orcas suffer in captivity. Sometinmes credited with depopularizing the term 'killer whale' in favor of 'orca.'</p>
<h4><i>Blackfish</i><sup>9</sup> (2013), American</h4>
<p><i>Blackfish</i> is one of the most famous documentaries of all time, detailing several cases of orcas killing humans while in captivity, especially their trainers, as a result of psychological damage inherent to the buisness model of SeaWorld and similar parks. The film negativty impacted public perception and the popularity of SeaWorld.</p>
<h4><i>Tico and Friends</i><sup>10</sup> (1994), Japan</h4>
<p>A children's anime about a young girl who travels around the world with her scientist father and orca companion. The series continues to be popular in both America and Japan, and a film continuation is currently in the works.</p>
<p>Not to mention the popularity of captive orca shows in venues such as SeaWorld internationally.</p>
