<h3>Human Impact </h3><p>Despite there being accounts of frightening encounters with orcas going back to the <a href="orca-head.html">Roman Empire</a>, there has <u>never</u> been a reported instance of a wild orca killing a human. In stark contrast, there were "nearly two dozen" human fatalities by orca in captivity from the 70s to the 2000s<sup>11</sup> <i>alone</i>, a period that was arguably the peak of commercialized orca captivity. Not all of these deaths occured at SeaWorld locations but at similar theme attractions, many of whom SeaWorld had affiliations with and would sell orcas known to be violent to. Many deaths were those of trainers who, from all accounts, cared greatly for the animals that would kill them. 
<p>These recorded orca deaths were largely non-accidental and often extremely violent, stemming from orcas known tendency to "play with their food." Those who died might have suffered a combination of drowning, bludgeoning, and puncture wounds. It should also be noted that these trainers especially approached their work wanting to do the best by these creatures and, if they were not killed on a whim, faced the consequences of systemic abuse they had little say in. SeaWorld and similar parks made a coordinated effort to underplay the risk associated with and incurred by these animals, leading in large part to these human fatalities.</p>
</p>
<h3>Animal Impact </h3><p>Science now recognizes captivity to be an adversely psychologically damaging experience for orcas. The majority of orcas are not captured to be studied, for medical emergencies, or to promote breeding in endanger groups, but for human entertainment. A large part of why captivity is dangerous for both orcas and humans is because orcas have a high emotional intelligence, and one of the highest general intelligences of any animal on Earth. The human consequence of this is often purposeful cruelty from orcas to nearby humans in what is tantamount to revenge (a behavior they also exhibit in the wild). Orcas, for their part, have strong familial, particularly maternal, bonds, which inevitably will lead them to great distress in the breeding programs common to SeaWorld, which often involve separating mother and child.</p> 
<p>SeaWorld could internally transfer a calf born to its mother at the San Diego location to its Orlando location with no possiblity of reunification, not to mention that it might also sell the same calf to a park in Spain. </p>
<p>Orca mothers can sense when their children are taken from them, even when they're in separate pools with no visiblity of the other; the mother will often call out to her missing calf for weeks. Such separations can lead to depression, self-harming, and as mentioned, violence towards humans. </p>
<p>Another issue faced by those captured or raised in captivity is physical or social weakness when compared to wild orcas, that make it next to impossible for them to integrate into complex orca cultures and societies upon release. Though SeaWorld has thankfully ended its breeding program and scaled down orca shows, most of their orcas can never be released.</p>

    <h3>Southern Residents</h3>
<p>From "The killer whales of the Pacific Northwest" by Orca Conservancy:</p>
<p>
    The Southern Resident killer whales are a genetically distinct population of orcas in the Pacific Northwest. This unique population is on the verge of extinction with only 73 remaining individuals. The Southern Residents face multiple threats, with the top three being lack of food, pollution, and vessel noise. 
</p>
<p>
    The main food source of the Southern Resident orcas is salmon, primarily chinook salmon, which is rapidly on the decline. The wild salmon face a variety of threats which include dams, diminishing habitat, warming waters, pollution and toxic runoff, receding snowpack, disease, parasites, and more. Chinook salmon, the main food source of the Southern Residents, is especially sensitive to pollution and warm waters. As we see historic lows in the salmon stocks throughout the region, there is a direct correlation between the decline of the Southern Residents and their lack of presence in the waters. They are now traveling further and longer to find food.
</p>
<p>The orca population of the Pacific Northwest is some of the most contaminated marine mammals in the world. Hazardous toxins known as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) cause extensive health effects on wildlife such as developmental defects, reproductive disruption, immunotoxicity, increased risk of cancer, and more. POPs are fat-soluble, or “fat loving” chemicals that are stored in fatty lipd cells making them difficult to expel. The three major POPs impacting orcas are Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs), and Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) which have been used in everything from electronics, paints, clothing, pesticides, and more. 
</p>
<p>Orcas use echolocation (a physiological process that uses sound waves to identify objects) to locate and hunt prey. The summer habitat of the Southern Residents is a very urban and highly trafficked waterway. Constant noise is generated by oil tankers, freighters, ferries, cruise ships, commercial and private vessels, and more. All of this human-caused noise interferes with the orcas’ ability to communicate, hunt, and locate prey due to their reliance on echolocation. The underwater noise results in a loss of foraging time, a reduction in food intake, and also limits their ability to communicate.
</p>
<p>All three of these threats interact producing additive or synergistic effects, meaning they all work together to add additional stress to this struggling population. Like humans, when orcas don’t get sufficient food and nutrients, their bodies begin to metabolize their fat reserves which are full of harmful toxins increasing their risk of health issues and illness. The vessel noise inhibits the orcas’ ability to locate and hunt their prey. As a result, the Southern Residents are malnourished, traveling further to find food, and have a more difficult time finding food due to noise pollution.<sup>11</sup>
